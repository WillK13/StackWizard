## Intro
StackWizard is a Python pip package which automatically searches Stack Overflow when a user has an error. The algorithm analyzes your code in proper context and finds the most relevant question and answer to your error. The answer and a link are then included in the error message. The package is optimized to not add much time to computation while still providing accurate assistance.
